## Purpose 

>“If you don’t know exactly where you’re going, how will you know when you get there?”

― Steve Maraboli, Life, the Truth, and Being Free

Some people excel at setting long-term goals and using them to plan their daily actions. Many others do not - we get lost. Our aims are fuzzy, or worse, completely unarticulated. You blink and 5 or 10 years have passed, meanwhile your aims are still fuzzy and you are not executing against YOUR plan that you designed for YOURSELF. 

TopView is for people that want to fully align their 5 year plan with their daily todo list - there should be no separation. TopView does this by removing the cognitive gap between your long-term aims/goals and daily actions. How you ask? Keep reading.

You begin to understand here how outcomes (the results you design for your life) cascade down to the shorter time horizons. So if you set a 5 year outcome with a date of 2020, it will show up in your 1 year plan when the year hits 2020.

The cascading outcomes work across all levels so if you plan finish X by Wednesday just know that Wednesday X will be sitting in Today.
