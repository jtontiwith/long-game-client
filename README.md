# TopView
TopView is a simple but powerful life planning application. Align your 5 year plan to your daily todo list and get your damn life on track! 

## Purpose 

>“If you don’t know exactly where you’re going, how will you know when you get there?”

― Steve Maraboli, Life, the Truth, and Being Free

Some people excel at setting long-term goals and using them to plan their daily actions. Many others do not - we get lost. Our aims are fuzzy, or worse, completely unarticulated. You blink and 5 or 10 years have passed, meanwhile your aims are still fuzzy and you are not executing against YOUR plan that you designed for YOURSELF. 

TopView is for people that want to fully align their 5 year plan with their daily todo list - there should be no separation. TopView does this by removing the cognitive gap between your long-term aims/goals and daily actions. How you ask? Keep reading.
